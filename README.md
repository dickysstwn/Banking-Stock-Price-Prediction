# Banking Stock Price Prediction

This repository is an analysis of the prediction of the closing price of banking stocks in Indonesia specifically on two prominent bank stocks (ARTO and BRIS) and two stocks that experienced a significant decline (BBNI and BMRI) during the Covid-19 pandemic by comparing two deep learning algorithms (LSTM and GRU) as a modelling method. The data used is taken from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) for the last five years (31 December 2018 to 29 December 2023) with the 'Close' attribute as the target to be predicted.
